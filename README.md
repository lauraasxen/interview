# InterView

InterView is a Python program designed to simplify the customization and arrangement of icons on the Windows desktop for improved usability. It provides users with the ability to view and arrange their desktop icons in different formats, such as grid or list, and refresh the desktop to apply changes.

## Features

- **View Desktop Icons**: Lists all the shortcut and folder icons currently on the user's desktop.
- **Arrange Icons**: Provides a basic framework to arrange icons in different formats (grid or list).
- **Refresh Desktop**: Programmatically refreshes the desktop to reflect changes.

## Requirements

- Windows Operating System
- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interview.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory.
   ```bash
   cd interview
   ```

## Usage

Run the program using Python:

```bash
python interview.py
```

The program will list all desktop icons and arrange them based on the specified arrangement type. It will then refresh the desktop to reflect any changes.

## Note

- This program currently prints the icons and desired arrangement. The actual repositioning of icons is not implemented and would require additional Windows API interactions for full functionality.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and modify desktop icons.
